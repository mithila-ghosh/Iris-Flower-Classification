# Iris Flower Classification

This project is a machine learning-based classification model that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements. The model is trained using the **Iris dataset** and three popular machine learning algorithms: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Random Forest**.

## Project Overview

In this project, we are using the Iris dataset to build classification models. The dataset contains the following columns:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Target: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The task is to predict the species of the flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.

## Models Used

1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Random Forest**

## Features

- Trained models using **cross-validation** to evaluate performance.
- Evaluated models using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **f1-score**, and **confusion matrix**.
- Compared model performances using **cross-validation accuracy** and visualized results using a bar chart.
